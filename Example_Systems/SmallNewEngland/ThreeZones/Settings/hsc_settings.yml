ModelH2: 1 #Turn on Hydrogen Supply Chain modelling capabilities
H2PipeInteger: 0 # Whether to model pipeline capacity as discrete or integer - 0 - continuous capacity, 1- discrete capacity
H2GenCommit: 0 # Continuous or discrete capacity representaiton of H2 production technologies with unit commitment; 0 = modeled as continuous variables; 1 = modeled as integer variables;
H2NetworkExpansion: 0 # Transmission network expansionl; 0 = not active; 1 = active systemwide
H2CO2Cap: 2 # CO2 emissions cap for HSC only; 0 = not active (no CO2 emission limit); 1 = mass-based emission limit constraint; 2 = load + rate-based emission limit constraint; 3 = generation + rate-based emission limit constraint; 4 = emissions penalized via a carbon price
