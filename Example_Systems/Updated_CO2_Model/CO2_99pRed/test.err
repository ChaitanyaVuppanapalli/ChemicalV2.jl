┌ Warning: Axis contains one element: 365. If intended, you can safely ignore this warning. To explicitly pass the axis with one element, pass `[365]` instead of `365`.

┌ Warning: The addition operator has been used on JuMP expressions a large number of times. This warning is safe to ignore but may indicate that model generation is slower than necessary. For performance reasons, you should not add expressions in a loop. Instead of x += y, use add_to_expression!(x,y) to modify x in place. If y is a single variable, you may also use add_to_expression!(x, coef, y) for x += coef*y.
