In a typical binary unit commitment formulation, each unit is either on or off.  With the clustered unit commitment formulation, one or more cluster(s) of similar generators are clustered by type and zone (typically using heat rate and fixed OM cost to create clusters), and the integer commitment state variable for each cluster varies from zero to the number of units in the cluster, fracy_kz^textrmETHEOmega_kz^textrmETHEsize.  As discussed in \\cite{Palmintier2014}, this approach replaces the large set of binary commitment decisions and associated constraints, which scale directly with the number of individual units, with a smaller set of integer commitment states and  constraints, one for each cluster k.  The dimensionality of the problem thus scales with the number of units of a given type in each zone, rather than by the number of discrete units, significantly improving computational efficiency.  However, this method entails the simplifying assumption that all clustered units have identical parameters (e.g., capacity size, ramp rates, heat rate) and that all committed units in a given time step t are operating at the same power output per unit.\n\nPower balance expressions\n\nContributions to the power balance expression from each thermal resources with unit commitment k in mathcalUC are also defined as:\n\nbeginequation*\n\tPowerBal_THE = sum_k in mathcalUC x_kzt^textrmETHE forall k in mathcalUC\nendequation*\n\nStartup and shutdown events (thermal plant cycling)\n\nCapacitated limits on unit commitment decision variables\n\nThermal resources subject to unit commitment k in mathcalUC adhere to the following constraints on commitment states, startup events, and shutdown events, which limit each decision to be no greater than the maximum number of discrete units installed (as per the following three constraints):\n\nbeginequation*\n\tn_kzt^textrmETHE leq fracy_kz^textrmETHEOmega^textrmETHEsize_kz quad forall k in mathcalUC z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendequation*\n\nbeginequation*\n\tn_kzt^textrmEUP leq fracy_kz^textrmETHEOmega^textrmETHEsize_kz quad forall k in mathcalUC z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendequation*\n\nbeginequation*\n\tn_kzt^textrmEDN leq fracy_kz^textrmETHEOmega_kz^textrmETHEsize quad forall k in mathcalUC z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendequation*\n\nwhere decision n_kzt^textrmETHE designates the commitment state of generator cluster k in zone z at time t,  decision n_kzt^textrmEUP represents number of startup decisions,  decision n_kzt^textrmEDN represents number of shutdown decisions,  y_kz^textrmETHE is the total installed capacity, and parameter Omega_kz^textrmETHEsize is the unit size.

Previously, the state of charge balance for storage (as defined in storage_all()) assumed that state of charge at the beginning and end of each representative period has to be the same.  In other words, the amount of hydrogen built up or consumed by storage technology s in zone z over the representative period m, Delta U_szm^textrmHSTO = 0.  This assumption implicitly excludes the possibility of transferring hydrogen from one representative period to the other which could be cost-optimal when the capital cost of hydrogen storage capacity is relatively small.  To model long-duration hydrogen storage using representative periods, we replace the state of charge equation, such that the first term on the right hand side accounts for change in hydrogen storage inventory associated with representative period m (Delta U_szm^textrmHSTO), which could be positive (net accumulation) or negative (net reduction).\n\nbeginequation*\n\tU_sz(m-1)timestau^period+1^textrmHSTO = left(1-eta_sz^textrmHSTOlossright) times left(U_szmtimes tau^period - Delta U_szmright) - frac1eta_sz^textrmtextrmHSTODISx_sz(m-1)times tau^period+1^textrmHSTO + eta_sz^textrmHSTOCHAx_sz(m-1)times tau^period+1^textrmHSTO quad quad forall s in mathcalS^LDES z in mathcalZ m in mathcalM\nendequation*\n\nBy definition mathcalT^start=left(m-1right) times tau^period+1  m in mathcalM, which implies that this constraint is defined for all values of t in T^start.\n\nHydrogen storage inventory change input periods\n\nWe need additional variables and constraints to approximate hydrogen exchange between representative periods, while accounting for their chronological occurence in the original input time series data and the possibility that two representative periods may not be adjacent to each other (see Figure below).  To implement this, we introduce a new variable U_szn that models inventory of storage technology s in mathcalS in zone z in each input period n in mathcalN.  Additionally we define a function mapping, f n rightarrow m, that uniquely maps each input period n to its corresponding representative period m. This mapping is available as an output of the process used to identify representative periods (E.g. k-means clustering Mallapragada et al., 2018).\n\n(Image: Modeling inter-period hydrogen exchange via long-duration storage when using representative period temporal resolution to approximate annual grid operations) Figure. Modeling inter-period hydrogen exchange via long-duration storage when using representative period temporal resolution to approximate annual grid operations\n\nThe following two equations define the hydrogen storage inventory at the beginning of each input period n+1 as the sum of storage inventory at begining of previous input period n plus change in storage inventory for that period.  The latter is approximated by the change in storage inventory in the corresponding representative period, identified per the mapping f(n).  The second constraint relates the storage level of the last input period, N, with the storage level at the beginning of the first input period.  Finally, if the input period is also a representative period, then a third constraint enforces that initial storage level estimated by the intra-period storage balance constraint should equal the initial storage level estimated from the inter-period storage balance constraints.  Note that N refers to the last modeled period.\n\nbeginequation*\n\tU_szn+1^textrmHSTO = U_szn^textrmHSTO + Delta U_szf(n) quad forall s in mathcalS^LDES z in mathcalZ n in mathcalNsetminusN\nendequation*\n\nbeginequation*\n\tU_sz1^textrmHSTO = U_szN^textrmHSTO + Delta U_szf(N)^textrmHSTO quad forall s in mathcalS^LDES z in mathcalZ n = N\nendequation*\n\nbeginequation*\n\tU_szn^textrmHSTO = U_szf(n) times tau^period^textrmHSTO - Delta U_szm^textrmHSTO quad forall s in mathcalS^LDES z in mathcalZ n in mathcalN^rep\nendequation*\n\nFinally, the next constraint enforces that the initial storage level for each input period n must be less than the installed energy capacity limit.

As implemented, flexible demand resources (y in mathcalDF) are characterized by: a) maximum deferrable demand as a fraction of available capacity in a particular time step t, rho^max_yzt, b) the maximum time this demand can be advanced and delayed, defined by parameters, tau^advance_yz and tau^delay_yz, respectively and c) the energy losses associated with shifting demand, eta_yz^dflex.\n\nTracking total deferred demand\n\nThe operational constraints governing flexible demand resources are as follows.\n\nThe first two constraints model keep track of inventory of deferred demand in each time step.  Specifically, the amount of deferred demand remaining to be served (Gamma_yzt) depends on the amount in the previous time step minus the served demand during time step t (Theta_yzt) while accounting for energy losses associated with demand flexibility, plus the demand that has been deferred during the current time step (Pi_yzt). Note that variable Gamma_yzt in mathbbR, forall y in mathcalDF t  in mathcalT.

As implemented, flexible demand resources (f in mathcalDF mathcalDF subseteq mathcalG) are characterized by: a) maximum deferrable demand as a fraction of available capacity in a particular time step t, R_fzt^EFLEX, b) the maximum time this demand can be advanced and delayed, defined by parameters, tau^advance_fz and tau^delay_fz, respectively and c) the energy losses associated with shifting demand, eta_fz^EFLEX.\n\nTracking total deferred power demand\n\nThe operational constraints governing flexible demand resources are as follows.\n\nThe first two constraints model keep track of inventory of deferred demand in each time step. Specifically, the amount of deferred demand remaining to be served (x_fzt^EFLEX) depends on the amount in the previous time step minus the served demand during time step t (Theta_yzt) while accounting for energy losses associated with demand flexibility, plus the demand that has been deferred during the current time step (Pi_yzt). Note that variable Gamma_fzt in mathbbR, forall f in mathcalDF t in mathcalT. Similar to hydro inventory or storage state of charge constraints, for the first time step of the year (or each representative period), we define the deferred demand level based on level of deferred demand in the last time step of the year (or each representative period).\n\nbeginaligned\nGamma_yzt = Gamma_yzt-1 -eta_yz^dflexTheta_yzt +Pi_yzt quad forall y in mathcalDF z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT^interior \nGamma_yzt = Gamma_yzt +tau^period-1 -eta_yz^dflexTheta_yzt +Pi_yzt quad forall y in mathcalDF z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT^start\nendaligned\n\nBounds on available demand flexibility\n\nAt any given time step, the amount of demand that can be shifted or deferred cannot exceed the maximum deferrable demand, defined by product of the availability factor (rho^max_yz) times the available capacity(Delta^total_yzt).\n\nbeginaligned\n    Pi_yzt leq rho^max_yztDelta_yz quad forall f in mathcalDF z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nMaximum time delay and advancements\n\nDelayed demand must then be served within a fixed number of time steps.

Previously, the state of charge balance for storage (as defined in storage_all()) assumed that state of charge at the beginning and end of each representative period has to be the same.  In other words, the amount of energy built up or consumed by storage technology s in zone z over the representative period m, Delta U_szm^textrmESTO = 0.  This assumption implicitly excludes the possibility of transferring energy from one representative period to the other which could be cost-optimal when the capital cost of energy storage capacity is relatively small.  To model long-duration energy storage using representative periods, we replace the state of charge equation, such that the first term on the right hand side accounts for change in storage inventory associated with representative period m (Delta U_szm^textrmESTO), which could be positive (net accumulation) or negative (net reduction).\n\nbeginequation*\n\tU_sz(m-1)timestau^period+1 = left(1-eta_sz^textrmESTOlossright) times left(U_szmtimes tau^period - Delta U_szmright) - frac1eta_sz^textrmtextrmESTODISx_sz(m-1)times tau^period+1^textrmESTO + eta_sz^textrmESTOCHAx_sz(m-1)times tau^period+1^textrmESTO quad forall s in mathcalS^LDES z in mathcalZ m in mathcalM\nendequation*\n\nBy definition mathcalT^start=left(m-1right) times tau^period+1  m in mathcalM, which implies that this constraint is defined for all values of t in T^start.\n\nStorage inventory change input periods\n\nWe need additional variables and constraints to approximate energy exchange between representative periods, while accounting for their chronological occurence in the original input time series data and the possibility that two representative periods may not be adjacent to each other (see Figure below).  To implement this, we introduce a new variable U_szn that models inventory of storage technology s in mathcalS in zone z in each input period n in mathcalN.  Additionally we define a function mapping, f n rightarrow m, that uniquely maps each input period n to its corresponding representative period m. This mapping is available as an output of the process used to identify representative periods (E.g. k-means clustering Mallapragada et al., 2018).\n\n(Image: Modeling inter-period energy exchange via long-duration storage when using representative period temporal resolution to approximate annual grid operations) Figure. Modeling inter-period energy exchange via long-duration storage when using representative period temporal resolution to approximate annual grid operations\n\nThe following two equations define the storage inventory at the beginning of each input period n+1 as the sum of storage inventory at begining of previous input period n plus change in storage inventory for that period.  The latter is approximated by the change in storage inventory in the corresponding representative period, identified per the mapping f(n).  The second constraint relates the storage level of the last input period, N, with the storage level at the beginning of the first input period.  Finally, if the input period is also a representative period, then a third constraint enforces that initial storage level estimated by the intra-period storage balance constraint should equal the initial storage level estimated from the inter-period storage balance constraints.  Note that N refers to the last modeled period.\n\nbeginequation*\n\tU_szn+1^textrmESTO = U_szn^textrmESTO + Delta U_szf(n) quad forall s in mathcalS^LDES z in mathcalZ n in mathcalNsetminusN\nendequation*\n\nbeginequation*\n\tU_sz1^textrmESTO = U_szN^textrmESTO + Delta U_szf(N)^textrmESTO quad forall s in mathcalS^LDES z in mathcalZ n = N\nendequation*\n\nbeginequation*\n\tU_szn^textrmESTO = U_szf(n) times tau^period^textrmESTO - Delta U_szm^textrmESTO quad forall s in mathcalS^LDES z in mathcalZ n in mathcalN^rep\nendequation*\n\nFinally, the next constraint enforces that the initial storage level for each input period n must be less than the installed energy capacity limit.  This constraint ensures that installed energy storage capacity is consistent with the state of charge during both the operational time periods t during each sample period m as well as at the start of each chronologically ordered input period n in the full annual time series.\n\nbeginequation*\n    U_szn^textrmESTO leq y_sz^textrmESTOENE quad forall s in mathcalS^LDES z in mathcalZ n in mathcalN\nendequation*\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"h2_core/#Hydrogen-Supply-Chain-Policies","page":"Hydrogen Core","title":"Hydrogen Supply Chain Policies","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"h2_core/","page":"Hydrogen Core","title":"Hydrogen Core","text":"Modules = [DOLPHYN]\nPages = [\"HSC/model/policies/co2_cap_hsc.jl\"]","category":"page"},{"location":"h2_core/#DOLPHYN.co2_cap_hsc-Tuple{JuMP.Model, Dict, Dict}","page":"Hydrogen Core","title":"DOLPHYN.co2_cap_hsc","text":"co2_cap_hsc(EP::Model, inputs::Dict, setup::Dict)\n\nThis policy constraints mimics the CO_2 emissions cap and permit trading systems, allowing for emissions trading across each zone for which the cap applies. The constraint p in mathcalP^CO_2 can be flexibly defined for mass-based or rate-based emission limits for one or more model zones, where zones can trade CO_2 emissions permits and earn revenue based on their CO_2 allowance. Note that if the model is fully linear (e.g. no unit commitment or linearized unit commitment), the dual variable of the emissions constraints can be interpreted as the marginal CO_2 price per tonne associated with the emissions target. Alternatively, for integer model formulations, the marginal CO_2 price can be obtained after solving the model with fixed integer/binary variables.\n\nThe CO_2 emissions limit can be defined in one of the following ways: a) a mass-based limit defined in terms of annual CO_2 emissions budget (in million tonnes of CO2), b) a load-side rate-based limit defined in terms of tonnes CO_2 per MWh of demand and c) a generation-side rate-based limit defined in terms of tonnes CO_2 per MWh of generation.\n\nMass-based emissions constraint\n\nMass-based emission limits are implemented in the following expression. For each constraint, p in mathcalP^CO_2_mass, we define a set of zones z in mathcalZ^CO_2_pmass that can trade CO_2 allowance. Input data for each constraint  p in mathcalP^CO_2_mass requires the CO_2 allowance/ budget for each model zone, epsilon^CO_2_zp mass, to be provided in terms of million metric tonnes. For every generator y, the parameter epsilon_yz^CO_2 reflects the specific CO_2 emission intensity in tCO_2/MWh associated with its operation.

Note that if a limit is applied to each zone separately, then the set mathcalZ^CO_2_pmass will contain only one zone with no possibility of trading. If a system-wide emission limit constraint is applied, then mathcalZ^CO_2_pmass will be equivalent to a set of all zones.\n\nLoad-side rate-based emissions constraint\n\nWe modify the right hand side of the above mass-based constraint, p in mathcalP^CO_2_load, to set emissions target based on a CO_2 emission rate limit in tCO_2/MWh times the total demand served in each zone. In the following constraint, total demand served takes into account non-served energy and storage related losses.

We define capacity reserve margin constraint for subsets of zones, z in mathcalZ^CRM_p, and each subset stands for a locational deliverability area (LDA) or a reserve sharing group.  For thermal resources, the available capacity is the total capacity in the LDA derated by the outage rate, epsilon_kzp^CRM.  For storage (s in mathcalS), variable renewable energy (r in mathcalVRE), and flexibile demand resources (y in mathcalDF), the available capacity is the net injection into the transmission network in time step t derated by the derating factor, also stored in the parameter, epsilon_yzp^CRM.  If the imported capacity is eligible to provide capacity to the CRM constraint, the inbound powerflow on all lines mathcalL_p^in in time step t will be derated to form the available capacity from outside of the LDA.  The reverse is true as well: the outbound derated powerflow on all lines mathcalL_p^out in time step t is taken out from the total available capacity.  The derating factor should be equal to the expected availability of the resource during periods when the capacity reserve constraint is binding (e.g. accounting for forced outages during supply constrained periods) and is similar to derating factors used in the capacity markets. On top of the flexible demand resources, load curtailment can also provide capacity (i.e., demand response or load management).  We allow all segments of voluntary load curtailment, s geq 2 in mathcalSEG, to contribute to capacity requirements. The first segment s = 1 in mathcalSEG corresponds to involuntary demand curtailment or emergency load shedding at the price cap or value of lost load, and thus does not contribute to reserve requirements.

Note that if the model is fully linear (e.g. no unit commitment or linearized unit commitment), the dual variable of the emissions constraints can be interpreted as the marginal CO_2 price per tonne associated with the emissions target.  Alternatively, for integer model formulations, the marginal CO_2 price can be obtained after solving the model with fixed integer/binary variables.\n\nThe CO_2 emissions limit can be defined in one of the following ways:  a) a mass-based limit defined in terms of annual CO_2 emissions budget (in million tonnes of CO2),  b) a load-side rate-based limit defined in terms of tonnes CO_2 per MWh of demand and  c) a generation-side rate-based limit defined in terms of tonnes CO_2 per MWh of generation.\n\nMass-based emissions constraint\n\nMass-based emission limits are implemented in the following expression.

The losses function f^textrmEloss(cdot) will depend on the configuration used to model losses (see below).\n\nAccounting for Transmission and Network Expansion Between Zones\n\nTransmission flow constraints are modeled using a 'transport method', where power flow, x_lt^textrmENET, on each line (or more likely a 'path' aggregating flows across multiple parallel lines) is constrained to be less than or equal to the line's maximum power transfer capacity, y_l^textrmENETexisting, plus any transmission capacity added on that line (for lines eligible for expansion in the set mathcalE).  The additional transmission capacity, y_l^textrmENETnew, is constrained by a maximum allowed reinforcement, overliney_l^textrmENETnew, for each line l in mathcalE.\n\nbeginequation*\n\t-y_l^textrmENETexisting leq x_lt^textrmENET leq y_l^textrmENETexisting quad forall l in (mathcalL setminus mathcalE) t in mathcalT\nendequation*\n\nbeginequation*\n\t-(y_l^textrmENETexisting + y_l^textrmENETnew) leq x_lt^textrmENET leq (y_l^textrmENETexisting + y_l^textrmENETnew) quad forall l in mathcalE t in mathcalT\nendequation*\n\nbeginequation*\n\ty_l^textrmENETnew leq overliney_l^textrmENETnew quad forall l in mathcalE\nendequation*\n\nAccounting for Transmission Losses\n\nTransmission losses due to power flows can be accounted for in three different ways. \n\n{\\textbf The first option} is to neglect losses entirely, setting the value of the losses function to zero for all lines at all hours. \n\n{\\textbf The second option} is to assume that losses are a fixed percentage, eta_l^textrmENET, of the magnitude of power flow on each line, mid x_lt^textrmENET mid (e.g., losses are a linear function of power flows). \n\n{\\textbf the third option} is to calculate losses, ell_lt, by approximating a quadratic-loss function of power flow across the line using a piecewise-linear function with total number of segments equal to the size of the set mathcalM.\n\nbeginequation*\n\tf^textrmEloss(cdot) = \n\tbegincases \n\t0  textif textlosses0 \n\teta_l^textrmENETtimes mid x_lt^textrmENET mid  textif textlosses1 \n\tell_lt textif textlosses2 \n\tendcases\n\tquad forall l in mathcalL t in mathcalT\nendequation*\n\nFor the second option, an absolute value approximation is utilized to calculate the magnitude of the power flow on each line (reflecting the fact that negative power flows for a line linking nodes z and z^prime represents flows from node z^prime to z and causes the same magnitude of losses as an equal power flow from i to j).  This absolute value function is linearized such that the flow in the line must be equal to the subtraction of the auxiliary variable for flow in the positive direction, x_lt^textrmENET+, and the auxiliary variable for flow in the negative direction, x_lt^textrmENET-, of the line.  Then, the magnitude of the flow is calculated as the sum of the two auxiliary variables.  The sum of positive and negative directional flows are also constrained by the maximum line flow capacity.\n\nbeginaligned\n\tx_lt^textrmENET = x_lt^textrmENET+ - x_lt^textrmENET- quad forall l in mathcalL t in mathcalT \n\tmid x_lt^textrmENET mid =  x_lt^textrmENET+  + x_lt^textrmENET- quad forall l in mathcalL t in mathcalT \n\tx_lt^textrmENET+ + x_lt^textrmENET- leq y_l^textrmENETexisting quad forall l in mathcalL t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nIf discrete unit commitment decisions are modeled, ``phantom losses'' can be observed wherein the auxiliary variables for flows in both directions (x_lt^textrmENET+ and x_lt^textrmENET-) are both increased to produce increased losses so as to avoid cycling a thermal generator and incurring start-up costs or opportunity costs related to minimum down times.  This unrealistic behavior can be eliminated via inclusion of additional constraints and a set of auxiliary binary variables, ON_lt^textrmENET+ in 01 forall l in mathcalL. Then the following additional constraints are created:\n\nbeginaligned\n\tx_lt^textrmENET+ leq TransON_lt^textrmENET+  quad forall l in mathcalL t in mathcalT \n\tx_lt^textrmENET- leq (y_l^textrmENETexisting + y_l^textrmENETnew) - TransON_lt^textrmENET+ quad forall l in mathcalL t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nwhere TransON_lt^textrmENET+ is a continuous variable, representing the product of the binary variable ON_lt^textrmENET+ and the expression, (y_l^textrmENETexisting + y_l^textrmENETnew).  This product cannot be defined explicitly, since it will lead to a bilinear expression involving two variables.  Instead, we enforce this definition via the Glover's Linearization as shown below (also the McCormick Envelopes constraints for bilinear expressions, which is exact when one of the variables is binary).\n\nbeginaligned\n\tTransON_lt^textrmENET+ leq (y_l^textrmENETexisting + overliney_l^textrmENETnew) times TransON_lt^textrmENET+   quad forall l in mathcalL t in mathcalT \n\tTransON_lt^textrmENET+ leq (y_l^textrmENETexisting + y_l^textrmENETnew)   quad forall l in mathcalL t in mathcalT \n\tTransON_lt^textrmENET+ leq (y_l^textrmENETexisting + y_l^textrmENETnew) - (y_l^textrmENETexisting + overliney_l^textrmENETnew) times(1- TransON_lt^textrmENET+)  quad forall l in mathcalL t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nThese constraints permit only the positive or negative auxiliary flow variables to be non-zero at a given time period, not both.\n\nFor the third option, losses are calculated as a piecewise-linear approximation of a quadratic function of power flows.  In order to do this, we represent the absolute value of the line flow variable by the sum of positive stepwise flow variables (mathcalS_mlt^textrmENET+ mathcalS_mlt^textrmENET-), associated with each partition of line losses computed using the corresponding linear expressions.  This can be understood as a segmentwise linear fitting (or first order approximation) of the quadratic losses function.  The first constraint below computes the losses a the accumulated sum of losses for each linear stepwise segment of the approximated quadratic function, including both positive domain and negative domain segments.  A second constraint ensures that the stepwise variables do not exceed the maximum size per segment.  The slope and maximum size for each segment are calculated as per the method in \\cite{Zhang2013}.\n\nbeginaligned\n\t ell_lt = fracvarphi^ohm_l(varphi^volt_l)^2bigg( sum_m in mathcalM( S^+_mltimes mathcalS_mlt^textrmENET+ + S^-_mltimes mathcalS_mlt^textrmENET-) bigg)  quad forall l in mathcalL t in mathcalT \n\t textquad Where \n\t quad S_ml^textrmENET+ = frac2+4 times sqrt2times (m-1)1+sqrt2 times (2 times M-1) (y_l^textrmENETexisting + overliney_l^textrmENETnew)  quad forall m in 1 colon M l in mathcalL \n\t quad S_ml^textrmENET- = frac2+4 times sqrt2times (m-1)1+sqrt2 times (2 times M-1) (y_l^textrmENETexisting + overliney_l^textrmENETnew)  quad forall m in 1 colon M l in mathcalL \n\t \n\t mathcalS_mlt^textrmENET+ mathcalS_mlt^textrmENET- = overlinemathcalS_ml  quad forall m in 1M l in mathcalL t in mathcalT \n\t textquad Where \n\t quad overlineS_lz =  begincases frac(1+sqrt2)1+sqrt2 times (2 times M-1)  (y_l^textrmENETexisting + overliney_l^textrmENETnew)  textif m = 1 \n\tfrac2 times sqrt2 1+sqrt2 times (2 times M-1) (y_l^textrmENETexisting + overliney_l^textrmENETnew)  textif m  1 endcases\nendaligned\n\nNext, a constraint ensures that the sum of auxiliary segment variables (m geq 1) minus the \"zero\" segment (which allows values to go into the negative domain) from both positive and negative domains must total the actual power flow across the line, and a constraint ensures that the sum of negative and positive flows do not exceed the maximum flow for the line.\n\nbeginaligned\n\tsum_m in 1M (mathcalS_mlt^textrmENET+) - mathcalS_0lt^textrmENET+ =  x_lt^textrmENET  quad forall l in mathcalL t in mathcalT \n\tsum_m in 1M (mathcalS_mlt^textrmENET-) - mathcalS_0lt^textrmENET- =  - x_lt^textrmENET\nendaligned\n\nAs with losses option 2, this segment-wise approximation of a quadratic loss function also permits 'phantom losses' to avoid cycling thermal units when discrete unit commitment decisions are modeled.  In this case, the additional constraints below are also added to ensure that auxiliary segments variables do not exceed maximum value per segment and that they are filled in order; i.e., one segment cannot be non-zero unless prior segment is at its maximum value.  Binary constraints deal with absolute value of power flow on each line.  If the flow is positive, mathcalS^+_0lt must be zero; if flow is negative, mathcalS_0lt^textrmENET+ must be positive and takes on value of the full negative flow, forcing all mathcalS_mlt^textrmENET+ other segments (m geq 1) to be zero.  Conversely, if the flow is negative, mathcalS_0lt^textrmENET- must be zero; if flow is positive, mathcalS_0lt^textrmENET- must be positive and takes on value of the full positive flow, forcing all mathcalS_mlt^textrmENET- other segments (m geq 1) to be zero.  Requiring segments to fill in sequential order and binary variables to ensure variables reflect the actual direction of power flows are both necessary to eliminate ``phantom losses'' from the solution.  These constraints and binary decisions are ommited if the model is fully linear.\n\nbeginaligned\n\tmathcalS_mlt^textrmENET+ =    overlinemathcalS_ml times ON_mlt^textrmENET+  quad forall m in 1M forall l in mathcalL t in mathcalT \n\tmathcalS_mlt^textrmENET- =    overlinemathcalS_ml times ON_mlt^textrmENET-  quad forall m in 1M forall l in mathcalL t in mathcalT \n\tmathcalS_mlt^textrmENET+ geq ON_m+1lt^textrmENET+ times overlinemathcalS_ml  quad forall m in 1M forall l in mathcalL t in mathcalT \n\tmathcalS_mlt^textrmENET- geq ON_m+1lt^EENT- times overlinemathcalS_ml  quad forall m in 1M forall l in mathcalL t in mathcalT \n\tmathcalS_0lt^textrmENET+ leq y_l^textrmENETexisting times (1 - ON_1lt^EENT+)  quad forall l in mathcalL t in mathcalT \n\tmathcalS_0lt^textrmENET- leq y_l^textrmENETexisting times (1 - ON_1lt^EENT-)  quad forall l in mathcalL t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"core/#Unit-Commitment","page":"Core","title":"Unit Commitment","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"core/","page":"Core","title":"Core","text":"Modules = [DOLPHYN]\nPages = [\"GenX/model/core/ucommit.jl\"]","category":"page"},{"location":"core/#DOLPHYN.ucommit-Tuple{JuMP.Model, Dict, Int64}","page":"Core","title":"DOLPHYN.ucommit","text":"ucommit(EP::Model, inputs::Dict, UCommit::Int)\n\nThis function creates decision variables and cost expressions associated with thermal plant unit commitment or start-up and shut-down decisions (cycling on/off)\n\nUnit commitment decision variables\n\nCommitment state variable n_kzt^textrmETHE of generator cluster k in zone z at time t forall k in mathcalK z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT.\n\nStartup decision variable n_kzt^textrmEUP of generator cluster k in zone z at time t forall k in mathcalK z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT.\n\nShutdown decision variable n_kzt^textrmEDN of generator cluster k in zone z at time t forall k in mathcalK z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT.\n\nThe variable defined in this file named after vCOMMIT covers n_kzt^textrmETHE.\n\nThe variable defined in this file named after vSTART covers n_kzt^textrmEUP.\n\nThe variable defined in this file named after vSHUT covers n_kzt^textrmEDN.\n\nCost expressions\n\nThe total cost of start-ups across all generators subject to unit commitment (k in mathcalUC mathcalUC subseteq mathcalG) and all time periods t is expressed as:\n\nbeginequation*\n\ttextrmC^textrmEstart = sum_k in mathcalUC sum_t in mathcalT omega_t times textrmc_k^textrmEstart times n_kzt^textrmEUP\nendequation*\n\nIf set UCommit to 1, the unit commitment variables are set to integer types.

Alternatively, if time step t is the first time step of a representative period, then storage inventory at t is defined based on the last time step of the representative period. Thus, when using representative periods, the storage balance constraint for hydro resources does not allow for energy exchange between representative periods.\n\nNote: in future updates, an option to model hydro resources with large reservoirs that can transfer energy across sample periods will be implemented, similar to the functions for modeling long duration energy storage in long_duration_storage.jl.\n\nRamping Limits\n\nThe following constraints enforce hourly changes in power output (ramps down and ramps up) to be less than the maximum ramp rates (kappa^down_yz and kappa^up_yz ) in per unit terms times the total installed capacity of technology y (Delta^total_yz).\n\nbeginaligned\nTheta_yzt - Theta_yzt-1 leq kappa^up_yz times Delta^total_yz\nhspace2 cm  forall y in mathcalW z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nbeginaligned\nTheta_yzt-1 - Theta_yzt leq kappa^down_yz Delta^total_yz\nhspace2 cm  forall y in mathcalW z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nRamping constraints are enforced for all time steps except the first time step of the year or first time of each representative period when using representative periods to model grid operations.\n\nPower generation and stream flow bounds\n\nElectricity production plus total spilled power from hydro resources is constrained to always be above a minimum output parameter, rho^min_yz, to represent operational constraints related to minimum stream flows or other demands for water from hydro reservoirs.

Storage inventory balance at beginning of each representative period The constraints in this section are used to approximate the behavior of long-duration energy storage technologies when approximating annual grid operations by modeling operations over representative periods. Previously, the state of charge balance for storage (as defined in storage_all()) assumed that state of charge at the beginning and end of each representative period has to be the same. In other words, the amount of energy built up or consumed by storage technology o in zone z over the representative period m, Delta Q_ozm = 0. This assumption implicitly excludes the possibility of transferring energy from one representative period to the other which could be cost-optimal when the capital cost of energy storage capacity is relatively small. To model long-duration energy storage using representative periods, we replace the state of charge equation, such that the first term on the right hand side accounts for change in storage inventory associated with representative period m (Delta Q_ozm), which could be positive (net accumulation) or negative (net reduction).\n\nbeginaligned\n Gamma_oz(m-1)times tau^period+1  =left(1-eta_oz^lossright)times left(Gamma_ozmtimes tau^period -Delta Q_ozmright) -  \n frac1eta_oz^dischargeTheta_oz(m-1)times tau^period+1 + eta_oz^chargePi_oz(m-1)times tau^period+1 quad forall o in mathcalO^LDES z in mathcalZ m in mathcalM\nendaligned\n\nBy definition mathcalT^start=left(m-1right) times tau^period+1  m in mathcalM, which implies that this constraint is defined for all values of t in T^start. Storage inventory change input periods We need additional variables and constraints to approximate energy exchange between representative periods, while accounting for their chronological occurence in the original input time series data and the possibility that two representative periods may not be adjacent to each other (see Figure below). To implement this, we introduce a new variable Q_oz n that models inventory of storage technology o in O in zone z in each input period n in mathcalN. Additionally we define a function mapping, f n rightarrow m, that uniquely maps each input period n to its corresponding representative period m. This mapping is available as an output of the process used to identify representative periods (E.g. k-means clustering Mallapragada et al., 2018). (Image: Modeling inter-period energy exchange via long-duration storage when using representative period temporal resolution to approximate annual grid operations) Figure. Modeling inter-period energy exchange via long-duration storage when using representative period temporal resolution to approximate annual grid operations The following two equations define the storage inventory at the beginning of each input period n+1 as the sum of storage inventory at begining of previous input period n plus change in storage inventory for that period. The latter is approximated by the change in storage inventory in the corresponding representative period, identified per the mapping f(n).  The second constraint relates the storage level of the last input period, N, with the storage level at the beginning of the first input period. Finally, if the input period is also a representative period, then a third constraint enforces that initial storage level estimated by the intra-period storage balance constraint should equal the initial storage level estimated from the inter-period storage balance constraints. Note that N refers to the last modeled period.\n\nbeginaligned\n Q_ozn+1 = Q_ozn + Delta Q_ozf(n)\nquad forall  o in mathcalO^LDES z in mathcalZ n in mathcalNsetminusN\nendaligned\n\nbeginaligned\n Q_oz1 = Q_ozN + Delta Q_ozf(N)\nquad forall  o in mathcalO^LDES z in mathcalZ n = N\nendaligned\n\nbeginaligned\n Q_ozn =Gamma_ozf(n)times tau^period - Delta Q_ozm\nquad forall  o in mathcalO^LDES z in mathcalZ n in   mathcalN^rep\nendaligned\n\nFinally, the next constraint enforces that the initial storage level for each input period n must be less than the installed energy capacity limit. This constraint ensures that installed energy storage capacity is consistent with the state of charge during both the operational time periods t during each sample period m as well as at the start of each chronologically ordered input period n in the full annual time series.\n\nbeginaligned\n    Q_ozn leq Delta^total energy_oz\nquad forall n in mathcalN o in mathcalO^LDES\nendaligned\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"investment_charge/#Investment-Charge","page":"Investment Charge","title":"Investment Charge","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"investment_charge/","page":"Investment Charge","title":"Investment Charge","text":"Modules = [DOLPHYN]\nPages = [\"src/GenX/model/resources/storage/investment_charge.jl\"]","category":"page"},{"location":"investment_charge/#DOLPHYN.investment_charge-Tuple{JuMP.Model, Dict}","page":"Investment Charge","title":"DOLPHYN.investment_charge","text":"investment_charge(EP::Model, inputs::Dict)\n\nThis function defines the expressions and constraints keeping track of total available storage charge capacity (s in mathcalS^asym mathcalS^asym subseteq mathcalS) as well as constraints on capacity retirements.
