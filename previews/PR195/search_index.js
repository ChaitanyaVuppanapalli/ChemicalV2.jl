Resources can include generators, storage, and flexible or time shiftable demand/loads.\nZone Integer representing zone number where the resource is located.\nTechnology type flags \nNew_Build {-1, 0, 1}, Flag for resource (storage, generation) eligibility for capacity expansion.\n New_Build = 1: eligible for capacity expansion and retirement.\n New_Build = 0: not eligible for capacity expansion, eligible for retirement.\n New_Build = -1: not eligible for capacity expansion or retirement.\nTHERM {0, 1, 2}, Flag to indicate membership in set of thermal resources (e.g. nuclear, combined heat and power, natural gas combined cycle, coal power plant)\n THERM = 0: Not part of set (default)\n THERM = 1: If the power plant relies on thermal energy input and subject unit commitment constraints/decisions if UCommit >= 1 (e.g. cycling decisions/costs/constraints).\n THERM = 2: If the power plant relies on thermal energy input and is subject to simplified economic dispatch constraints (ramping limits and minimum output level but no cycling decisions/costs/constraints).\nCap_size Size (MW) of a single generating unit. This is used only for resources with integer unit commitment (THERM = 1) - not relevant for other resources.\nVRE {0, 1}, Flag to indicate membership in set of dispatchable (or curtailable) variable renewable energy resources (onshore wind, offshore wind, utility-scale solar PV, and distributed solar PV subject to dispatch signals).\n VRE = 0: Not part of set (default)\n VRE = 1: Dispatchable variable renewable energy (VRE) resources.\nNum_VRE_bins Number of resource availability profiles considered for each VRE resource per zone.

Num_VRE_bins capacity investment decision variables and 1 generator RID used to define technology power output at each time step (and in each zone). Example: Suppose we are modeling 3 bins of wind profiles for each zone. Then include 3 rows with wind resource names as Wind_1, Wind_2, and Wind_3 and a corresponding increasing sequence of RIDs. Set Num_VRE_bins for the generator with smallest RID, Wind_1, to be 3 and set Num_VRE_bins for the other rows corresponding to Wind_2 and Wind_3, to be zero. By setting Num_VRE_bins for Wind_2 and Wind_3, the model eliminates the power outputs variables for these generators. The power output from the technology across all bins is reported in the power output variable for the first generator. This allows for multiple bins without significantly increasing number of model variables (adding each bin only adds one new capacity variable and no operational variables).

are a consistent feature of the model under all configurations, the user has several options with regards to representing the operational constraints on various thermal power plants (e.g., coal, gas, nuclear, and biomass generators). Unit commitment (e.g., start-up and shut-down) decisions Morales-España et al., 2013 (Layer 3) can be modeled at the individual power plant level (as per De Sisternes Jimenez, 2014); by using an efficient clustering of similar or identical units (as per Palmintier, 2011, Palmintier, 2013, Palmintier, 2014); by using a linear relaxation (or convex hull) of the integer unit commitment constraints set; or ignoring unit commitment decisions entirely and treating generator output as fully continuous. Furthermore, different levels of resolution can be selected for each individual resource type, as desired (e.g., larger thermal units can be represented with integer unit commitment decisions while smaller units can be treated as fully continuous). In such a manner, the model can be configured to represent operating constraints on thermal generators at a level of resolution that achieves a desired balance between abstraction error and computational tractability and provides sufficient accuracy to generate insights for the problem at hand.","category":"page"},{"location":"model_introduction/","page":"Model Introduction","title":"Model Introduction","text":"The model can also be configured to consider commitment of capacity to supply frequency regulation (symmetric up and down) and operating reserves (up) needed by system operators to robustly resolve short-term uncertainty in load and renewable energy forecasts and power plant or transmission network failures (Layer 4).

(A DC optimal power flow formulation is in development.) In cases where a nodal or zonal transmission model is employed, network capacity expansion decisions can be modeled or ignored, and transmission losses can be represented either as a linear function of power flows or a piecewise linear approximation of a quadratic function of power flows between nodes or zones (as per Zhang et al., 2013, Fitiwi et al., 2016), with the number of segments in the piecewise approximation specified by the user as desired.
