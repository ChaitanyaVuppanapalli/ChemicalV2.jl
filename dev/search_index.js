(See Constraints 1-3 in the code)\n\nCommitment state constraint linking start-up and shut-down decisions\n\nAdditionally, the following constarint maintains the commitment state variable across time,  n_gzt^textrmHGEN, as the sum of the commitment state in the prior, n_gzt-1^textrmHGEN,  period plus the number of units started in the current period, n_gzt^HUP,  minus the number of units shut down in the current period, n_gzt^HDN:\n\nbeginaligned\n    n_gzt^textrmHGEN = n_gzt-1^textrmHGEN + n_gzt^textrmHUP - n_gzt^textrmHDN quad forall g in mathcalUC z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT^interior \n    n_gzt^textrmHGEN = n_gzt +tau^period-1^textrmHGEN + n_gzt^textrmHUP - n_gzt^textrmHDN quad forall g in mathcalUC z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT^start\nendaligned\n\n(See Constraint 4 in the code)\n\nLike other time-coupling constraints, this constraint wraps around to link the commitment state in the first time step of the year (or each representative period), t in mathcalT^start, to the last time step of the year (or each representative period), t+tau^period-1.\n\nRamping constraints\n\nThermal resources subject to unit commitment (k in mathcalUC) adhere to the following ramping constraints on hourly changes in power output:\n\nbeginaligned\n    x_gzt-1^textrmHGEN - x_gzt^textrmHGEN leq kappa_gz^textrmHDN times Omega_gz^textrmHGENsize times left(n_gzt^textrmHUP - n_gzt^textrmHDNright) \n    qquad - underlinerho_gzt^textrmHGEN times Omega_gz^textrmHGENsize times n_gzt^textrmHDN \n    qquad + textmin(overlinerho_gzt^textrmHGEN textmax(underlinerho_gzt^textrmHGEN kappa_gz^textrmHGEN)) times Omega_gz^textrmHGENsize times n_gzt^textrmHDN \n    quad forall g in mathcalUC z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT \nendaligned\n\nbeginaligned\n    x_gzt^textrmHGEN - x_gzt-1^textrmHGEN leq kappa_gz^textrmHUP times Omega_gz^textrmHGENsize times left(n_gzt^textrmHUP - n_gzt^textrmHDNright) \n    qquad + textmin(overlinerho_gzt^textrmHGEN textmax(underlinerho_gzt^textrmHGEN kappa_kz^textrmHUP)) times Omega_kz^textrmHGENsize times n_gzt^textrmHDN \n    qquad - underlinerho_gzt^textrmHGEN times Omega_gz^textrmHGENsize times n_gzt^textrmHDN quad forall g in mathcalUC z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\n(See Constraints 5-6 in the code)\n\nwhere decision x_gzt^textrmHGEN is the energy injected into the grid by technology y in zone z at time t, parameter kappa_gzt^textrmHUP, kappa_Gzt^textrmHDN is the maximum ramp-up or ramp-down rate as a percentage of installed capacity, parameter underlinerho_gz^textrmHGEN is the minimum stable power output per unit of installed capacity,  and parameter overlinerho_gzt^textrmHGEN is the maximum available generation per unit of installed capacity. These constraints account for the ramping limits for committed (online) units as well as faster changes in power enabled by units starting or shutting down in the current time step.\n\nbeginequation*\n    x_gzt^textrmHGEN geq underlinerho_gzt^textrmHGEN times Omega_gz^textrmHGENsize times n_gzt^textrmHUP quad forall g in mathcalUC z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendequation*\n\nbeginequation*\n    x_gzt^textrmHGEN geq overlinerho_gz^textrmHGEN times Omega_gz^textrmHGENsize times n_gzt^textrmHUP quad forall g in mathcalUC z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendequation*\n\n(See Constraints 7-8 the code)\n\nMinimum and maximum up and down time\n\nThermal resources subject to unit commitment adhere to the following constraints on the minimum time steps after start-up before a unit can shutdown again (minimum up time) and the minimum time steps after shut-down before a unit can start-up again (minimum down time):\n\nbeginequation*\n    n_gzt^textrmHGEN geq displaystyle sum_tau = t-tau_gz^textrmHUP^t n_gztau^textrmHUP quad forall g in mathcalUC z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendequation*\n\nbeginequation*\n    fracy_gz^textrmHGENOmega_gz^textrmHGENsize - n_gzt^textrmHUP geq displaystyle sum_tau = t-tau_gz^textrmHDN^t n_gztau^textrmHDN quad forall g in mathcalUC z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendequation*\n\n(See Constraints 9-10 in the code)\n\nwhere tau_gz^textrmHUP and tau_gz^textrmHDN is the minimum up or down time for units in generating cluster g in zone z.\n\nLike with the ramping constraints, the minimum up and down constraint time also wrap around from the start of each time period to the end of each period. It is recommended that users of DOLPHYN must use longer subperiods than the longest min up/down time if modeling unit commitment. Otherwise, the model will report error.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"thermal/#Thermal","page":"Thermal","title":"Thermal","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"thermal/","page":"Thermal","title":"Thermal","text":"Modules = [DOLPHYN, GenX]\nPages = [\"GenX/src/model/resources/thermal/thermal.jl\"]","category":"page"},{"location":"solvers/#Configuring-the-Solvers","page":"Solvers","title":"Configuring the Solvers","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"solvers/","page":"Solvers","title":"Solvers","text":"Modules = [DOLPHYN]\nPages = [\"configure_solver/configure_solver.jl\"]","category":"page"},{"location":"solvers/#DOLPHYN.configure_solver-Tuple{String, String}","page":"Solvers","title":"DOLPHYN.configure_solver","text":"configure_solver(solver::String, solver_settings_path::String)\n\nThis method returns a solver-specific MathOptInterface OptimizerWithAttributes optimizer instance to be used in the DOLPHYN.generate_model() method.\n\nThe \"solver\" argument is a string which specifies the solver to be used.

Previously, the state of charge balance for storage (as defined in storage_all()) assumed that state of charge at the beginning and end of each representative period has to be the same.  In other words, the amount of hydrogen built up or consumed by storage technology s in zone z over the representative period m, Delta U_szm^textrmHSTO = 0.  This assumption implicitly excludes the possibility of transferring hydrogen from one representative period to the other which could be cost-optimal when the capital cost of hydrogen storage capacity is relatively small.  To model long-duration hydrogen storage using representative periods, we replace the state of charge equation, such that the first term on the right hand side accounts for change in hydrogen storage inventory associated with representative period m (Delta U_szm^textrmHSTO), which could be positive (net accumulation) or negative (net reduction).\n\nbeginequation*\n    U_sz(m-1)timestau^period+1^textrmHSTO = left(1-eta_sz^textrmHSTOlossright) times left(U_szmtimes tau^period - Delta U_szmright) - frac1eta_sz^textrmtextrmHSTODISx_sz(m-1)times tau^period+1^textrmHSTO + eta_sz^textrmHSTOCHAx_sz(m-1)times tau^period+1^textrmHSTO quad quad forall s in mathcalS^LDES z in mathcalZ m in mathcalM\nendequation*\n\nBy definition mathcalT^start=left(m-1right) times tau^period+1  m in mathcalM, which implies that this constraint is defined for all values of t in T^start.\n\nHydrogen storage inventory change input periods\n\nWe need additional variables and constraints to approximate hydrogen exchange between representative periods, while accounting for their chronological occurence in the original input time series data and the possibility that two representative periods may not be adjacent to each other (see Figure below).  To implement this, we introduce a new variable U_szn that models inventory of storage technology s in mathcalS in zone z in each input period n in mathcalN.  Additionally we define a function mapping, f n rightarrow m, that uniquely maps each input period n to its corresponding representative period m. This mapping is available as an output of the process used to identify representative periods (E.g. k-means clustering Mallapragada et al., 2018).\n\n(Image: Modeling inter-period hydrogen exchange via long-duration storage when using representative period temporal resolution to approximate annual grid operations) Figure. Modeling inter-period hydrogen exchange via long-duration storage when using representative period temporal resolution to approximate annual grid operations\n\nThe following two equations define the hydrogen storage inventory at the beginning of each input period n+1 as the sum of storage inventory at begining of previous input period n plus change in storage inventory for that period.  The latter is approximated by the change in storage inventory in the corresponding representative period, identified per the mapping f(n).  The second constraint relates the storage level of the last input period, N, with the storage level at the beginning of the first input period.  Finally, if the input period is also a representative period, then a third constraint enforces that initial storage level estimated by the intra-period storage balance constraint should equal the initial storage level estimated from the inter-period storage balance constraints.  Note that N refers to the last modeled period.\n\nbeginequation*\n    U_szn+1^textrmHSTO = U_szn^textrmHSTO + Delta U_szf(n) quad forall s in mathcalS^LDES z in mathcalZ n in mathcalNsetminusN\nendequation*\n\nbeginequation*\n    U_sz1^textrmHSTO = U_szN^textrmHSTO + Delta U_szf(N)^textrmHSTO quad forall s in mathcalS^LDES z in mathcalZ n = N\nendequation*\n\nbeginequation*\n    U_szn^textrmHSTO = U_szf(n) times tau^period^textrmHSTO - Delta U_szm^textrmHSTO quad forall s in mathcalS^LDES z in mathcalZ n in mathcalN^rep\nendequation*\n\nFinally, the next constraint enforces that the initial storage level for each input period n must be less than the installed energy capacity limit.  This constraint ensures that installed energy storage capacity is consistent with the state of charge during both the operational time periods t during each sample period m as well as at the start of each chronologically ordered input period n in the full annual time series.\n\nbeginequation*\n    U_szn^textrmHSTO leq y_sz^textrmHSTOENE quad forall s in mathcalS^LDES z in mathcalZ n in mathcalN\nendequation*\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"load_h2_inputs/#Load-Hydrogen-Inputs","page":"HSC Inputs Functions","title":"Load Hydrogen Inputs","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"load_h2_inputs/","page":"HSC Inputs Functions","title":"HSC Inputs Functions","text":"Modules = [DOLPHYN]\nPages = [\"HSC/load_inputs/load_H2_inputs.jl\"]","category":"page"},{"location":"load_h2_inputs/#DOLPHYN.load_h2_inputs-Tuple{Dict, Dict, AbstractString}","page":"HSC Inputs Functions","title":"DOLPHYN.load_h2_inputs","text":"load_h2_inputs(inputs::Dict,setup::Dict,path::AbstractString)\n\nLoads various data inputs from multiple input .csv files in path directory and stores variables in a Dict (dictionary) object for use in model() function\n\ninputs: inputs -

Num_VRE_bins capacity investment decision variables and 1 generator RID used to define technology power output at each time step (and in each zone). Example: Suppose we are modeling 3 bins of wind profiles for each zone. Then include 3 rows with wind resource names as Wind_1, Wind_2, and Wind_3 and a corresponding increasing sequence of RIDs. Set Num_VRE_bins for the generator with smallest RID, Wind_1, to be 3 and set Num_VRE_bins for the other rows corresponding to Wind_2 and Wind_3, to be zero. By setting Num_VRE_bins for Wind_2 and Wind_3, the model eliminates the power outputs variables for these generators. The power output from the technology across all bins is reported in the power output variable for the first generator.

As implemented, flexible demand resources (y in mathcalDF) are characterized by: a) maximum deferrable demand as a fraction of available capacity in a particular time step t, rho^max_yzt, b) the maximum time this demand can be advanced and delayed, defined by parameters, tau^advance_yz and tau^delay_yz, respectively and c) the energy losses associated with shifting demand, eta_yz^dflex.\n\nTracking total deferred demand\n\nThe operational constraints governing flexible demand resources are as follows.\n\nThe first two constraints model keep track of inventory of deferred demand in each time step.  Specifically, the amount of deferred demand remaining to be served (Gamma_yzt) depends on the amount in the previous time step minus the served demand during time step t (Theta_yzt) while accounting for energy losses associated with demand flexibility, plus the demand that has been deferred during the current time step (Pi_yzt). Note that variable Gamma_yzt in mathbbR, forall y in mathcalDF t  in mathcalT. Similar to hydro inventory or storage state of charge constraints, for the first time step of the year (or each representative period), we define the deferred demand level based on level of deferred demand in the last time step of the year (or each representative period).\n\nbeginaligned\nGamma_yzt = Gamma_yzt-1 -eta_yz^dflexTheta_yzt +Pi_yzt hspace4 cm  forall y in mathcalDF z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT^interior \nGamma_yzt = Gamma_yzt +tau^period-1 -eta_yz^dflexTheta_yzt +Pi_yzt hspace4 cm  forall y in mathcalDF z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT^start\nendaligned\n\nBounds on available demand flexibility\n\nAt any given time step, the amount of demand that can be shifted or deferred cannot exceed the maximum deferrable demand, defined by product of the availability factor (rho^max_yt) times the available capacity(Delta^total_yz).\n\nbeginaligned\nPi_yt leq rho^max_yztDelta_yz hspace4 cm  forall y in mathcalDF z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nMaximum time delay and advancements\n\nDelayed demand must then be served within a fixed number of time steps. This is done by enforcing the sum of demand satisfied (Theta_yzt) in the following tau^delay_yz time steps (e.g., t + 1 to t + tau^delay_yz) to be greater than or equal to the level of energy deferred during time step t.\n\nbeginaligned\nsum_e=t+1^t+tau^delay_yzTheta_yze geq Gamma_yzt\n    hspace4 cm  forall y in mathcalDFz in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nA similar constraints maximum time steps of demand advancement. This is done by enforcing the sum of demand deferred (Pi_yt) in the following tau^advance_y time steps (e.g., t + 1 to t + tau^advance_y) to be greater than or equal to the total level of energy deferred during time t (-Gamma_yt). The negative sign is included to account for the established sign convention that treat demand deferred in advance of the actual demand is defined to be negative.\n\nbeginaligned\nsum_e=t+1^t+tau^advance_yzPi_yze geq -Gamma_yzt\n    hspace4 cm  forall y in mathcalDF z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nIf t is first time step of the year (or the first time step of the representative period), then the above two constraints are implemented to look back over the last n time steps, starting with the last time step of the year (or the last time step of the representative period).

emissions trading across each zone for which the cap applies. The constraint p in mathcalP^CO_2 can be flexibly defined for mass-based or rate-based emission limits for one or more model zones, where zones can trade CO_2 emissions permits and earn revenue based on their CO_2 allowance. Note that if the model is fully linear (e.g. no unit commitment or linearized unit commitment), the dual variable of the emissions constraints can be interpreted as the marginal CO_2 price per tonne associated with the emissions target. Alternatively, for integer model formulations, the marginal CO_2 price can be obtained after solving the model with fixed integer/binary variables.\n\nThe CO_2 emissions limit can be defined in one of the following ways: a) a mass-based limit defined in terms of annual CO_2 emissions budget (in million tonnes of CO2), b) a load-side rate-based limit defined in terms of tonnes CO_2 per MWh of demand and c) a generation-side rate-based limit defined in terms of tonnes CO_2 per MWh of generation.\n\nMass-based emissions constraint\n\nMass-based emission limits are implemented in the following expression. For each constraint, p in mathcalP^CO_2_mass, we define a set of zones z in mathcalZ^CO_2_pmass that can trade CO_2 allowance. Input data for each constraint  p in mathcalP^CO_2_mass requires the CO_2 allowance/ budget for each model zone, epsilon^CO_2_zp mass, to be provided in terms of million metric tonnes. For every generator y, the parameter epsilon_yz^CO_2 reflects the specific CO_2 emission intensity in tCO_2/MWh associated with its operation.  The resulting constraint is given as:\n\nbeginaligned\n    sum_z in mathcalZ^CO_2_pmass sum_y in mathcalG sum_t in mathcalT left(epsilon_yz^CO_2 times omega_t times Theta_yzt right)\n     leq sum_z in mathcalZ^CO_2_pmass epsilon^CO_2_zp mass hspace1 cm  forall p in mathcalP^CO_2_mass\nendaligned\n\nIn the above constraint, we include both power discharge and charge term for each resource to account for the potential for CO_2 emissions (or removal when considering negative emissions technologies) associated with each step. Note that if a limit is applied to each zone separately, then the set mathcalZ^CO_2_pmass will contain only one zone with no possibility of trading. If a system-wide emission limit constraint is applied, then mathcalZ^CO_2_pmass will be equivalent to a set of all zones.\n\nLoad-side rate-based emissions constraint\n\nWe modify the right hand side of the above mass-based constraint, p in mathcalP^CO_2_load, to set emissions target based on a CO_2 emission rate limit in tCO_2/MWh times the total demand served in each zone. In the following constraint, total demand served takes into account non-served energy and storage related losses. Here, epsilon_zpload^maxCO_2 denotes the emission limit in terms on tCO_2/MWh.\n\nbeginaligned\n    sum_z in mathcalZ^CO_2_pload sum_y in mathcalG sum_t in mathcalT left(epsilon_yz^CO_2 times omega_t times Theta_ytz right)\n    leq  sum_z in mathcalZ^CO_2_pload sum_t in mathcalT left(epsilon_zpload^CO_2 times  omega_t times D_zt right)   +  sum_z in mathcalZ^CO_2_pload sum_y in mathcalO  sum_t in mathcalT left(epsilon_zpload^CO_2 times omega_t times left(Pi_ytz - Theta_ytz right) right)   -  sum_z in mathcalZ^CO_2_pload sum_s in mathcalS  sum_t in mathcalT  left(epsilon_zpload^CO_2 times omega_t times Lambda_sztright) hspace1 cm  forall p in mathcalP^CO_2_load\nendaligned\n\nGenerator-side emissions rate-based constraint\n\nSimilarly, a generation based emission constraint is defined by setting the emission limit based on the total generation times the carbon emission rate limit in tCO_2/MWh of the region. The resulting constraint is given as:\n\nbeginaligned\n    sum_z in mathcalZ^CO_2_pgen sum_y in mathcalG sum_t in mathcalT  left(epsilon_yz^CO_2 times omega_t times Theta_ytz right) \n    leq sum_z in mathcalZ^CO_2_pgen sum_y in mathcalG sum_t in mathcalT  left(epsilon_zpgen^CO_2 times  omega_t times Theta_ytz right) quad forall p in mathcalP^CO_2_gen\nendaligned\n\nNote that the generator-side rate-based constraint can be used to represent a fee-rebate (``feebate'') system: the dirty generators that emit above the bar (epsilon_zpgen^maxCO_2) have to buy emission allowances from the emission regulator in the region z where they are located; in the same vein, the clean generators get rebates from the emission regulator at an emission allowance price being the dual variable of the emissions rate constraint.    \n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"h2_core/#Hydrogen-Resources-Investment","page":"Hydrogen Core","title":"Hydrogen Resources Investment","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"h2_core/","page":"Hydrogen Core","title":"Hydrogen Core","text":"Modules = [DOLPHYN]\nPages = [\"HSC/model/core/h2_investment.jl\"]","category":"page"},{"location":"h2_core/#DOLPHYN.h2_investment-Tuple{JuMP.Model, Dict, Dict}","page":"Hydrogen Core","title":"DOLPHYN.h2_investment","text":"h2_investment(EP::Model, inputs::Dict, UCommit::Int, Reserves::Int)\n\nSets up constraints common to all hydrogen generation resources.\n\nThis function defines the expressions and constraints keeping track of total available generation capacity y_k^textrmHGEN as well as constraints on capacity retirements.\n\nThis function defines the expressions and constraints keeping track of total available storage discharge capacity y_s^textrmtextrmHSTODIS as well as constraints on capacity retirements.\n\nThe expression defined in this file named after eH2GenTotalCap covers all variables y_k^textrmHTHE y_s^textrmtextrmHSTODIS.\n\nbeginequation*\n    y_g z^textrmHGEN = \n    begincases\n        y_k z^textrmHTHE quad if quad g in mathcalK \n        y_s z^textrmtextrmHSTODIS quad if quad g in mathcalS\n    endcases\n    quad forall g in mathcalG z in mathcalZ\nendequation*\n\nThis module additionally defines contributions to the objective function from variable costs of generation (variable OM plus fuel cost) from all resources over all time periods.\n\nThe total capacity of each resource (SMR, storage, electrolysis) is defined as the sum of the existing capacity plus the newly invested capacity minus any retired capacity.
