Such a time-domain reduction is often employed in CEMs as a way to balance model spatial and temporal resolution as well as representation of dispatch, while ensuring reasonable computational times.  The time-domain reduction method provided allows the user to automate these feature by specifying the various parameters related to the time-domain reduction algorithm (via time_domain_reduction_settings.yml described under  Model Inputs/Outputs documentations/Inputs), including the desired level of temporal resolution to be used in formulating the resulting optimization model.","category":"page"},{"location":"methods/","page":"Methods","title":"Methods","text":"Modules = [DOLPHYN]\nPages = [\"time_domain_reduction.jl\"]\nOrder = [:type, :function]","category":"page"},{"location":"power_balance/#Power-Balance","page":"Power Balance","title":"Power Balance","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"power_balance/","page":"Power Balance","title":"Power Balance","text":"The power balance constraint of the model ensures that electricity demand is met at every time step in each zone. As shown in the constraint, electricity demand, D_tz, at each time step and for each zone must be strictly equal to the sum of generation, Theta_yzt, from thermal technologies (mathcalH), curtailable variable renewable energy resources (mathcalVRE), must-run resources (mathcalMR), and hydro resources (mathcalW). At the same time, energy storage devices (mathcalO) can discharge energy, Theta_yzt to help satisfy demand, while when these devices are charging, Pi_yzt, they increase demand. For the case of flexible demand resources (mathcalDF), delaying demand, Pi_yzt, decreases demand while satisfying delayed demand, Theta_yzt, increases demand. Price-responsive demand curtailment, Lambda_szt, also reduces demand. Finally, power flows, Phi_lt, on each line l into or out of a zone (defined by the network map varphi^map_lz), are considered in the demand balance equation for each zone. By definition, power flows leaving their reference zone are positive, thus the minus sign in the below constraint. At the same time losses due to power flows increase demand, and one-half of losses across a line linking two zones are attributed to each connected zone.

Furthermore, different levels of resolution can be selected for each individual resource type, as desired (e.g., larger thermal units can be represented with integer unit commitment decisions while smaller units can be treated as fully continuous).

(A DC optimal power flow formulation is in development.) In cases where a nodal or zonal transmission model is employed, network capacity expansion decisions can be modeled or ignored, and transmission losses can be represented either as a linear function of power flows or a piecewise linear approximation of a quadratic function of power flows between nodes or zones (as per Zhang et al., 2013, Fitiwi et al., 2016), with the number of segments in the piecewise approximation specified by the user as desired.
