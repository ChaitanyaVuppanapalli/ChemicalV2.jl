Since storage resources generally represent a `cluster' of multiple similar storage devices of the same type/cost in the same zone, GenX permits storage resources to simultaneously charge and discharge (as some units could be charging while others discharge), with the simultaenous sum of charge, Pi_ozt, and discharge, Theta_ozt, also limited by the total installed power capacity, Delta^total_oz.

Note that as storage resources can contribute to regulation and reserves while either charging or discharging, the proxy variables f^charge_ozt f^discharge_ozt and r^charge_ozt r^discharge_ozt are created for storage resources where the total contribution to regulation and reserves, f_ozt r_ozt is the sum of the proxy variables.\n\nThese constraints are created with the function storage_symmetric_reserves() in storage_symmetric.jl.\n\nStorage with asymmetric charge and discharge capacity\n\nFor storage technologies with asymmetric charge and discharge capacities (all o in mathcalO^asym), charge rate, Pi_ozt, is constrained by the total installed charge capacity, Delta^total charge_oz, as follows:\n\nbeginaligned\n\t  Pi_ozt leq Delta^total charge_oz  quad forall o in mathcalO^asym z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nThese constraints are created with the function storage_asymmetric() in storage_asymmetric.jl.\n\nIf reserves are modeled, the above constraint is replaced by the following:\n\nbeginaligned\n\t  Pi_ozt + f^charge_ozt leq Delta^total charge_oz  quad forall o in mathcalO^asym z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nwhere f^+_y=ozt is the contribution of storage resources to frequency regulation while charging.\n\nThese constraints are created with the function storage_asymmetric_reserves() in storage_asymmetric.jl.\n\nAll storage resources\n\nThe following constraints apply to all storage resources, o in mathcalO, regardless of whether the charge/discharge capacities are symmetric or asymmetric.\n\nThe following two constraints track the state of charge of the storage resources at the end of each time period, relating the volume of energy stored at the end of the time period, Gamma_ozt, to the state of charge at the end of the prior time period, Gamma_ozt-1, the charge and discharge decisions in the current time period, Pi_ozt Theta_ozt, and the self discharge rate for the storage resource (if any), eta_oz^loss.  The first of these two constraints enforces storage inventory balance for interior time steps (t in mathcalT^interior), while the second enforces storage balance constraint for the initial time step (t in mathcalT^start).\n\nbeginaligned\n\t  Gamma_ozt =Gamma_ozt-1 - frac1eta_oz^dischargeTheta_ozt + eta_oz^chargePi_ozt - eta_oz^lossGamma_ozt-1  quad forall o in mathcalO z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT^interior\n\t  Gamma_ozt =Gamma_ozt+tau^period-1 - frac1eta_oz^dischargeTheta_ozt + eta_oz^chargePi_ozt - eta_oz^lossGamma_ozt+tau^period-1  quad forall o in mathcalO z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT^start\nendaligned\n\nWhen modeling the entire year as a single chronological period with total number of time steps of tau^period, storage inventory in the first time step is linked to storage inventory at the last time step of the period representing the year. Alternatively, when modeling the entire year with multiple representative periods, this constraint relates storage inventory in the first timestep of the representative period with the inventory at the last time step of the representative period, where each representative period is made of tau^period time steps. In this implementation, energy exchange between representative periods is not permitted. When modeling representative time periods, GenX enables modeling of long duration energy storage which tracks state of charge between representative periods enable energy to be moved throughout the year. If LongDurationStorage=1 and OperationWrapping=1, this function calls long_duration_storage() in long_duration_storage.jl to enable this feature.\n\nThe next constraint limits the volume of energy stored at any time, Gamma_ozt, to be less than the installed energy storage capacity, Delta^total energy_oz. Finally, the maximum discharge rate for storage resources, Pi_ozt, is constrained to be less than the discharge power capacity, Omega_ozt or the state of charge at the end of the last period, Gamma_ozt-1, whichever is lessor.\n\nbeginaligned\n\t  Gamma_ozt leq Delta^total energy_oz  quad forall o in mathcalO z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\n\t  Theta_ozt leq Delta^total_oz  quad forall o in mathcalO z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\n\t  Theta_ozt leq Gamma_ozt-1  quad forall o in mathcalO z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nThe above constraints are established in storage_all() in storage_all.jl.\n\nIf reserves are modeled, two pairs of proxy variables f^charge_ozt f^discharge_ozt and r^charge_ozt r^discharge_ozt are created for storage resources, to denote the contribution of storage resources to regulation or reserves while charging or discharging, respectively. The total contribution to regulation and reserves, f_ozt r_ozt is then the sum of the proxy variables:\n\nbeginaligned\n\t  f_ozt = f^charge_ozt + f^dicharge_ozt  quad forall o in mathcalO z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\n\t  r_ozt = r^charge_ozt + r^dicharge_ozt  quad forall o in mathcalO z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nThe total storage contribution to frequency regulation (f_ozt) and reserves (r_ozt) are each limited specified fraction of installed discharge power capacity (upsilon^reg_yz upsilon^rsv_yz), reflecting the maximum ramp rate for the storage resource in whatever time interval defines the requisite response time for the regulation or reserve products (e.g., 5 mins or 15 mins or 30 mins). These response times differ by system operator and reserve product, and so the user should define these parameters in a self-consistent way for whatever system context they are modeling.\n\nbeginaligned\n\tf_yzt leq upsilon^reg_yz times Delta^total_yz\n\thspace4 cm  forall y in mathcalW z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT \n\tr_yz t leq upsilon^rsv_yztimes Delta^total_yz\n\thspace4 cm  forall y in mathcalW z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nWhen charging, reducing the charge rate is contributing to upwards reserve and frequency regulation as it drops net demand. As such, the sum of the charge rate plus contribution to regulation and reserves up must be greater than zero. Additionally, the discharge rate plus the contribution to regulation must be greater than zero.\n\nbeginaligned\n\t  Pi_ozt - f^charge_ozt - r^charge_ozt geq 0  quad forall o in mathcalO z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\n\t  Theta_ozt - f^discharge_ozt geq 0  quad forall o in mathcalO z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nAdditionally, when reserves are modeled, the maximum charge rate and contribution to regulation while charging can be no greater than the available energy storage capacity, or the difference between the total energy storage capacity, Delta^total energy_oz, and the state of charge at the end of the previous time period, Gamma_ozt-1. Note that for storage to contribute to reserves down while charging, the storage device must be capable of increasing the charge rate (which increase net load).\n\nbeginaligned\n\t  Pi_ozt + f^charge_ozt leq Delta^energy total_oz - Gamma_ozt-1  quad forall o in mathcalO z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nFinally, the constraints on maximum discharge rate are replaced by the following, to account for capacity contributed to regulation and reserves:\n\nbeginaligned\n\t  Theta_ozt + f^discharge_ozt + r^discharge_ozt leq Delta^total_oz  quad forall o in mathcalO z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\n\t  Theta_ozt + f^discharge_ozt + r^discharge_ozt leq Gamma_ozt-1  quad forall o in mathcalO z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nThe above reserve related constraints are established by storage_all_reserves() in storage_all.jl\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"h2_long_duration_storage/#h2*long*duration_storage","page":"Long Duration","title":"h2longduration_storage","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"h2_long_duration_storage/","page":"Long Duration","title":"Long Duration","text":"DOLPHYN.h2_long_duration_storage(EP::Model, inputs::Dict)","category":"page"},{"location":"h2_long_duration_storage/#DOLPHYN.h2_long_duration_storage-Tuple{Model, Dict}","page":"Long Duration","title":"DOLPHYN.h2_long_duration_storage","text":"h2_long_duration_storage(EP::Model, inputs::Dict)\n\nThis function creates variables and constraints enabling modeling of long duration storage resources when modeling representative time periods.\n\nStorage inventory balance at beginning of each representative period\n\nThe constraints in this section are used to approximate the behavior of long-duration energy storage technologies when approximating annual grid operations by modeling operations over representative periods. Previously, the state of charge balance for storage (as defined in storage_all()) assumed that state of charge at the beginning and end of each representative period has to be the same. In other words, the amount of energy built up or consumed by storage technology o in zone z over the representative period m, Delta Q_ozm = 0. This assumption implicitly excludes the possibility of transferring energy from one representative period to the other which could be cost-optimal when the capital cost of energy storage capacity is relatively small. To model long-duration energy storage using representative periods, we replace the state of charge equation, such that the first term on the right hand side accounts for change in storage inventory associated with representative period m (Delta Q_ozm), which could be positive (net accumulation) or negative (net reduction).\n\nbeginaligned\n Gamma_oz(m-1)times tau^period+1  =left(1-eta_oz^lossright)times left(Gamma_ozmtimes tau^period -Delta Q_ozmright) -  \n frac1eta_oz^dischargeTheta_oz(m-1)times tau^period+1 + eta_oz^chargePi_oz(m-1)times tau^period+1 quad forall o in mathcalO^LDES z in mathcalZ m in mathcalM\nendaligned\n\nBy definition mathcalT^start=left(m-1right) times tau^period+1  m in mathcalM, which implies that this constraint is defined for all values of t in T^start.\n\nStorage inventory change input periods\n\nWe need additional variables and constraints to approximate energy exchange between representative periods, while accounting for their chronological occurence in the original input time series data and the possibility that two representative periods may not be adjacent to each other (see Figure below). To implement this, we introduce a new variable Q_oz n that models inventory of storage technology o in O in zone z in each input period n in mathcalN. Additionally we define a function mapping, f n rightarrow m, that uniquely maps each input period n to its corresponding representative period m. This mapping is available as an output of the process used to identify representative periods (E.g. k-means clustering Mallapragada et al., 2018).\n\n(Image: Modeling inter-period energy exchange via long-duration storage when using representative period temporal resolution to approximate annual grid operations) Figure. Modeling inter-period energy exchange via long-duration storage when using representative period temporal resolution to approximate annual grid operations\n\nThe following two equations define the storage inventory at the beginning of each input period n+1 as the sum of storage inventory at begining of previous input period n plus change in storage inventory for that period. The latter is approximated by the change in storage inventory in the corresponding representative period, identified per the mapping f(n).  The second constraint relates the storage level of the last input period, N, with the storage level at the beginning of the first input period. Finally, if the input period is also a representative period, then a third constraint enforces that initial storage level estimated by the intra-period storage balance constraint should equal the initial storage level estimated from the inter-period storage balance constraints. Note that N refers to the last modeled period.\n\nbeginaligned\n Q_ozn+1 = Q_ozn + Delta Q_ozf(n)\nquad forall  o in mathcalO^LDES z in mathcalZ n in mathcalNsetminusN\nendaligned\n\nbeginaligned\n Q_oz1 = Q_ozN + Delta Q_ozf(N)\nquad forall  o in mathcalO^LDES z in mathcalZ n = N\nendaligned\n\nbeginaligned\n Q_ozn =Gamma_ozf(n)times tau^period - Delta Q_ozm\nquad forall  o in mathcalO^LDES z in mathcalZ n in   mathcalN^rep\nendaligned\n\nFinally, the next constraint enforces that the initial storage level for each input period n must be less than the installed energy capacity limit. This constraint ensures that installed energy storage capacity is consistent with the state of charge during both the operational time periods t during each sample period m as well as at the start of each chronologically ordered input period n in the full annual time series.\n\nbeginaligned\n\tQ_ozn leq Delta^total energy_oz\nquad forall n in mathcalN o in

As implemented, flexible demand resources (y in mathcalDF) are characterized by: a) maximum deferrable demand as a fraction of available capacity in a particular time step t, rho^max_yzt, b) the maximum time this demand can be advanced and delayed, defined by parameters, tau^advance_yz and tau^delay_yz, respectively and c) the energy losses associated with shifting demand, eta_yz^dflex.\n\nTracking total deferred demand\n\nThe operational constraints governing flexible demand resources are as follows.\n\nThe first two constraints model keep track of inventory of deferred demand in each time step.  Specifically, the amount of deferred demand remaining to be served (Gamma_yzt) depends on the amount in the previous time step minus the served demand during time step t (Theta_yzt) while accounting for energy losses associated with demand flexibility, plus the demand that has been deferred during the current time step (Pi_yzt). Note that variable Gamma_yzt in mathbbR, forall y in mathcalDF t  in mathcalT. Similar to hydro inventory or storage state of charge constraints, for the first time step of the year (or each representative period), we define the deferred demand level based on level of deferred demand in the last time step of the year (or each representative period).\n\nbeginaligned\nGamma_yzt = Gamma_yzt-1 -eta_yz^dflexTheta_yzt +Pi_yzt hspace4 cm  forall y in mathcalDF z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT^interior \nGamma_yzt = Gamma_yzt +tau^period-1 -eta_yz^dflexTheta_yzt +Pi_yzt hspace4 cm  forall y in mathcalDF z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT^start\nendaligned\n\nBounds on available demand flexibility\n\nAt any given time step, the amount of demand that can be shifted or deferred cannot exceed the maximum deferrable demand, defined by product of the availability factor (rho^max_yt) times the available capacity(Delta^total_yz).\n\nbeginaligned\nPi_yt leq rho^max_yztDelta_yz hspace4 cm  forall y in mathcalDF z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nMaximum time delay and advancements\n\nDelayed demand must then be served within a fixed number of time steps. This is done by enforcing the sum of demand satisfied (Theta_yzt) in the following tau^delay_yz time steps (e.g., t + 1 to t + tau^delay_yz) to be greater than or equal to the level of energy deferred during time step t.\n\nbeginaligned\nsum_e=t+1^t+tau^delay_yzTheta_yze geq Gamma_yzt\n    hspace4 cm  forall y in mathcalDFz in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nA similar constraints maximum time steps of demand advancement. This is done by enforcing the sum of demand deferred (Pi_yt) in the following tau^advance_y time steps (e.g., t + 1 to t + tau^advance_y) to be greater than or equal to the total level of energy deferred during time t (-Gamma_yt). The negative sign is included to account for the established sign convention that treat demand deferred in advance of the actual demand is defined to be negative.\n\nbeginaligned\nsum_e=t+1^t+tau^advance_yzPi_yze geq -Gamma_yzt\n    hspace4 cm  forall y in mathcalDF z in mathcalZ t in mathcalT\nendaligned\n\nIf t is first time step of the year (or the first time step of the representative period), then the above two constraints are implemented to look back over the last n time steps, starting with the last time step of the year (or the last time step of the representative period).

The constraint p in mathcalP^CO_2 can be flexibly defined for mass-based or rate-based emission limits for one or more model zones, where zones can trade CO_2 emissions permits and earn revenue based on their CO_2 allowance. Note that if the model is fully linear (e.g. no unit commitment or linearized unit commitment), the dual variable of the emissions constraints can be interpreted as the marginal CO_2 price per tonne associated with the emissions target. Alternatively, for integer model formulations, the marginal CO_2 price can be obtained after solving the model with fixed integer/binary variables.\n\nThe CO_2 emissions limit can be defined in one of the following ways: a) a mass-based limit defined in terms of annual CO_2 emissions budget (in million tonnes of CO2), b) a load-side rate-based limit defined in terms of tonnes CO_2 per MWh of demand and c) a generation-side rate-based limit defined in terms of tonnes CO_2 per MWh of generation.\n\nMass-based emissions constraint\n\nMass-based emission limits are implemented in the following expression. For each constraint, p in mathcalP^CO_2_mass, we define a set of zones z in mathcalZ^CO_2_pmass that can trade CO_2 allowance. Input data for each constraint  p in mathcalP^CO_2_mass requires the CO_2 allowance/ budget for each model zone, epsilon^CO_2_zp mass, to be provided in terms of million metric tonnes. For every generator y, the parameter epsilon_yz^CO_2 reflects the specific CO_2 emission intensity in tCO_2/MWh associated with its operation.  The resulting constraint is given as:\n\nbeginaligned\n\tsum_z in mathcalZ^CO_2_pmass sum_y in mathcalG sum_t in mathcalT left(epsilon_yz^CO_2 times omega_t times Theta_yzt right)\n\t leq sum_z in mathcalZ^CO_2_pmass epsilon^CO_2_zp mass hspace1 cm  forall p in mathcalP^CO_2_mass\nendaligned\n\nIn the above constraint, we include both power discharge and charge term for each resource to account for the potential for CO_2 emissions (or removal when considering negative emissions technologies) associated with each step. Note that if a limit is applied to each zone separately, then the set mathcalZ^CO_2_pmass will contain only one zone with no possibility of trading. If a system-wide emission limit constraint is applied, then mathcalZ^CO_2_pmass will be equivalent to a set of all zones.\n\nLoad-side rate-based emissions constraint\n\nWe modify the right hand side of the above mass-based constraint, p in mathcalP^CO_2_load, to set emissions target based on a CO_2 emission rate limit in tCO_2/MWh times the total demand served in each zone. In the following constraint, total demand served takes into account non-served energy and storage related losses. Here, epsilon_zpload^maxCO_2 denotes the emission limit in terms on tCO_2/MWh.\n\nbeginaligned\n\tsum_z in mathcalZ^CO_2_pload sum_y in mathcalG sum_t in mathcalT left(epsilon_yz^CO_2 times omega_t times Theta_ytz right)\n\tleq  sum_z in mathcalZ^CO_2_pload sum_t in mathcalT  left(epsilon_zpload^CO_2 times  omega_t times D_zt right)   +  sum_z in mathcalZ^CO_2_pload sum_y in mathcalO  sum_t in mathcalT left(epsilon_zpload^CO_2 times omega_t times left(Pi_ytz - Theta_ytz right) right)   -  sum_z in mathcalZ^CO_2_pload sum_s in mathcalS  sum_t in mathcalT  left(epsilon_zpload^CO_2 times omega_t times Lambda_sztright) hspace1 cm  forall p in mathcalP^CO_2_load\nendaligned\n\nGenerator-side emissions rate-based constraint\n\nSimilarly, a generation based emission constraint is defined by setting the emission limit based on the total generation times the carbon emission rate limit in tCO_2/MWh of the region. The resulting constraint is given as:\n\nbeginaligned\nsum_z in mathcalZ^CO_2_pgen sum_y in mathcalG sum_t in mathcalT  left(epsilon_yz^CO_2 times omega_t times Theta_ytz right) \n\tleq sum_z in

generator-side rate-based constraint can be used to represent a fee-rebate (``feebate'') system: the dirty generators that emit above the bar (epsilon_zpgen^maxCO_2) have to buy emission allowances from the emission regulator in the region z where they are located; in the same vein, the clean generators get rebates from the emission regulator at an emission allowance price being the dual

entirely.","category":"page"},{"location":"model_introduction/","page":"Model Introduction","title":"Model Introduction","text":"For example, while investment and dispatch decisions (Layers 1 and 2) are a consistent feature of the model under all configurations, the user has several options with regards to representing the operational constraints on various thermal power plants (e.g., coal, gas, nuclear, and biomass generators). Unit commitment (e.g., start-up and shut-down) decisions Morales-España et al., 2013 (Layer 3) can be modeled at the individual power plant level (as per De Sisternes Jimenez, 2014); by using an efficient clustering of similar or identical units (as per Palmintier, 2011, Palmintier, 2013, Palmintier, 2014); by using a linear relaxation (or convex hull) of the integer unit commitment constraints set; or ignoring unit commitment decisions entirely and treating generator output as fully continuous. Furthermore, different levels of resolution can be selected for each individual resource type, as desired (e.g., larger thermal units can be represented with integer unit commitment decisions while smaller units can be treated as fully continuous). In such a manner, the model can be configured to represent operating constraints on thermal generators at a level of resolution that achieves a desired balance between abstraction error and computational tractability and provides sufficient accuracy to generate insights for the problem at hand.","category":"page"},{"location":"model_introduction/","page":"Model Introduction","title":"Model Introduction","text":"The model can also be configured to consider commitment of capacity to supply frequency regulation (symmetric up and down) and operating reserves (up) needed by system operators to robustly resolve short-term uncertainty in load and renewable energy forecasts and power plant or transmission network failures (Layer 4).

(A DC optimal power flow formulation is in development.) In cases where a nodal or zonal transmission model is employed, network capacity expansion decisions can be modeled or ignored, and transmission losses can be represented either as a linear function of power flows or a piecewise linear approximation of a quadratic function of power flows between nodes or zones (as per Zhang et al., 2013, Fitiwi et al., 2016), with the number of segments in the piecewise approximation specified by the user as desired. In a multi-zonal or nodal configuration, GenX can therefore consider siting generators in different locations, including balancing tradeoffs between access to different renewable resource quality, siting restrictions, and impacts on network congestions, power flows and losses.","category":"page"},{"location":"model_introduction/","page":"Model Introduction","title":"Model Introduction","text":"GenX also allows the user to specify several optional public policy constraints, such as CO2 emissions limits, minimum energy share requirements (such as renewable portfolio standard or clean energy standard policies), and minimum technology capacity requirements (e.g. technology deployment mandates).","category":"page"},{"location":"model_introduction/","page":"Model Introduction","title":"Model Introduction","text":"Finally, the model is usually configured to consider a full year of operating decisions at an hourly resolution, but as this is often not tractable when considering large-scale problems with high resolution in other dimensions, GenX is also designed to model a number of subperiods – typically multiday periods of chronologically sequential hourly operating decisions – that can be selected via appropriate statistical clustering methods to represent a full year of operations (De Sisternes Jimenez and Webster, 2013, De Sisternes Jimenez, 2014, Poncelet et al., 2016, Nahmmacher et al., 2016, Blanford et al., 2016, Merrick, 2016, Mallapragada et al., 2018). GenX ships with a built-in time-domain reduction package that uses k-means or k-medoids to cluster raw time series data for load (demand) profiles and resource capacity factor profiles into representative periods during the input processing stage of the model.
