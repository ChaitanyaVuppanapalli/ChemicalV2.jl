## Overview

GenX is a highly-configurable, [open source](https://github.com/GenXProject/GenX/blob/main/LICENSE) electricity resource capacity expansion model that incorporates several state-of-the-art practices in electricity system planning to offer improved decision support for a changing electricity landscape.

The model was [originally developed](https://energy.mit.edu/publication/enhanced-decision-support-changing-electricity-landscape/) by [Jesse D. Jenkins](https://mae.princeton.edu/people/faculty/jenkins) and [Nestor A. Sepulveda](https://energy.mit.edu/profile/nestor-sepulveda/) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is now jointly maintained by [a team of contributors](https://energy.mit.edu/genx/#team) at the MIT Energy Initiative (led by [Dharik Mallapragada](https://energy.mit.edu/profile/dharik-mallapragada/)) and the Princeton University ZERO Lab (led by Jenkins).

GenX is a constrained linear or mixed integer linear optimization model that determines the portfolio of electricity generation, storage, transmission, and demand-side resource investments and operational decisions to meet electricity demand in one or more future planning years at lowest cost, while subject to a variety of power system operational constraints, resource availability limits, and other imposed environmental, market design, and policy constraints.

GenX features a modular and transparent code structure developed in [Julia](http://julialang.org/) + [JuMP](http://jump.dev/). The model is designed to be highly flexible and configurable for use in a variety of applications from academic research and technology evaluation to public policy and regulatory analysis and resource planning. Depending on the planning problem or question to be studied, GenX can be configured with varying levels of model resolution and scope, with regards to: (1) temporal resolution of time series data such as electricity demand and renewable energy availability; (2) power system operational detail and unit commitment constraints; and (3) geospatial resolution and transmission network representation. The model is also capable of representing a full range of conventional and novel electricity resources, including thermal generators, variable renewable resources (wind and solar), run-of-river, reservoir and pumped-storage hydroelectric generators, energy storage devices, demand-side flexibility, demand response, and several advanced technologies such as long-duration energy storage.

## Requirements

GenX currently exists in version 0.1.0 and runs only on Julia v1.6.x and v1.5.x series, where x>=0 and a minimum version of JuMP v0.21.x. There is also an older version of GenX, which is also currently maintained and runs on Julia 1.3.x and 1.4.x series (For those users who has previously cloned GenX, and has been running it successfully so far, and therefore might be unwilling to run it on the latest version of Julia: please look into the GitHub branch, [old_version](https://github.com/GenXProject/GenX/tree/old_version)). It is currently setup to use one of the following open-source freely available solvers: A) [Clp](https://github.com/jump-dev/Clp.jl) for linear programming (LP) problems and (B) [Cbc](https://github.com/jump-dev/Cbc.jl) for mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problems. We also provide the option to use one of these two commercial solvers: C) [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com), and D) [CPLEX](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer). Note that using Gurobi and CPLEX requires a valid license on the host machine. There are two ways to run GenX with either type of solver options (open-source free or, licensed commercial) as detailed in the section, `Running an Instance of GenX`.

The file `julenv.jl` in the parent directory lists all of the packages and their versions needed to run GenX. You can see all of the packages installed in your Julia environment and their version numbers by running `pkg> status` on the package manager command line in the Jula REPL.

## Running an Instance of GenX

Download or clone the GenX repository on your machine in a directory named 'GenX'. Create this new directory in a location where you wish to store the GenXJulEnv environment.

The Run.jl file in each of the example sub-folders within `Example_Systems/` provides an example of how to use GenX.jl for capacity expansion modeling. The following are the main steps performed in the Run.jl script:

1. Establish path to environment setup files and GenX source files.
2. Read in model settings `genx_settings.yml` from the example directory.
3. Configure solver settings.
4. Load the model inputs from the example directory and perform time-domain clustering if required.
5. Generate a GenX model instance.
6. Solve the model.
7. Write the output files to a specified directory.

Here are step-by-step instructions for running Run.jl, following the two slightly different methods:
